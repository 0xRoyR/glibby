Glibby is a Python library designed to automate Azure attack paths. It simplifies and enhances interactions with Azure APIs, making it a powerful tool for developers and security professionals working with Azure environments.

---

## 💡 How Does It Work?

Glibby communicates with the Azure Graph API and Azure Resource Manager (RM) API over HTTPS. It is **not a CLI tool**; instead, it is intended to be imported and used as a Python library within your projects.

The tool draws inspiration from the "BARK" CLI tool by Andy Robbins, offering similar functionality but tailored for Python integration.

## 📖 Installation

### Install from PyPI

The easiest way to install Glibby is via PyPI:

```bash
pip install glibby
```

**PyPI URL**: [https://pypi.org/project/glibby/1.0.0/](https://pypi.org/project/glibby/1.0.0/)

## 📖 Usage

While comprehensive documentation is in progress, here’s an overview of the core components:

- **`UserAuthHandler`**:
  - A class for managing authentication for Azure Active Directory (AAD) user accounts.
  - Handles access tokens, refresh tokens, and related operations.

- **`SpnAuthHandler`**:
  - A class for managing authentication for Service Principal Names (SPNs) in AAD.
  - Obtains and refreshes access tokens for SPNs.

- **`GraphOperations`**:
  - A class that interacts with the Azure Graph API.
  - Requires a valid Graph API access token to perform operations like managing users and groups.

- **`RMOperations`**:
  - A class that interacts with the Azure Resource Manager (RM) API.
  - Requires a valid RM API access token to perform operations like managing Azure resources.

### 🔧 Example Usage

Here’s a quick example to authenticate to Azure with our user and assign ourselves the "Global Administrator" role

```python
from glibby import UserAuthHandler
from glibby import GraphOperations


def main():
    # Creds
    username = "USERNAME"
    password = "PASSWORD"
    tenant_id = "TENANT_ID"

    # Get Access Token
    weak_user_auth = UserAuthHandler(username=username, password=password)
    access_token = weak_user_auth.get_access_token(tenant_id=tenant_id, resource='graph')
    if not access_token:
        return
    
    # Assign the global administrator role to ourselves (if we have enough permissions to do it)
    graph = GraphOperations(access_token=access_token)
    global_admin = graph.get_role_definition('Global Administrator')
    if not global_admin:
        return
    
    user_id = graph.user.id_from_name(username)['object_id']
    if not user_id:
        return
    
    graph.assign_role_to_object(user_id, global_admin)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- After performing certain operations (e.g., assigning a role to a user or adding a user to a group), include a delay using `time.sleep()` for a few seconds. 
  - **Why?** Azure requires some time to process changes, even if it reports success immediately. Adding a short delay ensures your subsequent operations reflect these updates correctly.
